# hello-world
My name is Hamish Sansom
I started programming in BASIC on a TRS-80 in 1981
I started programming in K&R C on a PC in 1987.  I won a number of prizes and accolades for the applications and solutions I developed in C at Auckland University and at Vodafone (Newbury).
I stopped programming when I saw C morphing into C++ in 1992 and I didn't like it!
I've just started to look into programming again as a hobby and because I see there's growing debate that object oriented programming might not have been all it was sold as.
